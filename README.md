## Machine Learning Workflow

### 1. Data Loading

Vendor invoice data is loaded from an SQLite database.

### 2. Data Preparation

Input Features:

* Quantity
* Dollars

Target Variable:

* Freight

### 3. Model Training

The following algorithms are trained and evaluated:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression

### 4. Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using:

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
* R² Score

### 5. Best Model Selection

The best-performing model is automatically selected and saved as:

```text
Model/predict_freight_model.pkl
```

---

## Installation

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit joblib
```

---

## Training the Model

Run:

```bash
python train.py
```

This will:

* Load invoice data
* Train multiple machine learning models
* Compare performance metrics
* Save the best model

---

## Running the Streamlit Application

Run:

```bash
streamlit run App.py
```

After execution, Streamlit will provide a local URL such as:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

Open the URL in your browser.
